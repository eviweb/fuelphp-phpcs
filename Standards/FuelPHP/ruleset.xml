        Alternative if statements

        In some cases, a full if statement is a bit too much code for a simple conditional assignment or function call. 
        In those cases, you can use PHP's execution logic to use a shorter boolean-operator based syntax. 
        Using and means the second part only gets evaluated if the first part were true, using or means the second part only gets executed if the first part were false.
        Don't use this when both if and else are needed, just in cases like single conditional statements.

    <!--
        Comparing function/method returns and variables should be type aware, for example some functions may return false,
        and when comparing this return the type sensitive operators such as === or !==.
        Additionally, use of and or or is preferred over && or || for readability. 
        In some cases, this cannot be avoided and the use of && or || as its required may be used. 
        The ! should have spaces on both sides when used.
