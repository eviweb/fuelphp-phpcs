Assuming FuelPHPCS was installed inside ``./fuel/vendor`` using composer and the ``bin-dir`` is ``./fuel/vendor/bin``.    
Run ``./fuel/vendor/bin/fuelphpcs PROJECT_TO_SNIFF_DIRECTORY`` where 
*PROJECT_TO_SNIFF_DIRECTORY* is your fuel php project directory.     
    
### The old way

*PROJECT_TO_SNIFF_DIRECTORY* is your fuel php project directory.     
    
**BE AWARE not to use --tab-width phpcs option with another value than 0, 
this would disable tabs recognition !**
